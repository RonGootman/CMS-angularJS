# A Blogging CMS platfrom built with AngularJS

### This is a work in progress project

This is a final project of my Front End Development course and Netcraft Academy.

This project involves creating a simple content managment system app with AngularJS (Not Angular 2 / 4).

The app involves two major sections:
- Posts section where I can go through posts and filter them by artists / date / tag.  
- Admin section where I can modify create and delete posts.


All of the html and css (Bootstrap) structure has been already taken care of.

The gist of the project is add functionality to the site through angular.


## Current state of work
- Nearly completed the Posts section of the project by [following this guide](https://rongootman.github.io/CMS-angularJS/README.html).
- Still have to complete the sidebar-filters functionaly before moving on the the Admin portion of the project (right now it is just Static).
